# Agent Sandbox SDK Clients

## Overview

The `agent-sandbox` project provides two high-level, developer-friendly SDKs: a **Go client** and a **Python client**. These SDKs abstract away the underlying Kubernetes complexities and provide a simplified interface to programmatically manage Sandbox lifecycles, execute commands, and read/write files within secure sandbox environments. 

Both clients are designed for building AI agents, code interpreters, and secure workload runners, offering native idioms and seamless integration for their respective ecosystems.

### Python Client (`k8s-agent-sandbox`)
The Python client is distributed via PyPI. It features a rich, idiomatic Python experience including full sync/async parity, Pydantic data models for configuration validation, optional tracing capabilities, and **advanced extensions for GKE Pod Snapshots**. It natively uses context managers (`with` statements) for automatic resource cleanup.

### Go Client
The Go client is provided as part of the `sigs.k8s.io/agent-sandbox` Go module. It brings feature parity to the Go ecosystem for core sandbox functionality, catering to platform services and high-performance, concurrent agentic applications by fully supporting the standard Go `context.Context` for execution timeouts and cancellation.

## Detailed Differences

### 1. Concurrency and Async Patterns
*   **Python SDK:** Explicitly divides its API into synchronous (`SandboxClient`) and asynchronous (`AsyncSandboxClient`) sibling classes. This allows developers to seamlessly drop the SDK into asynchronous orchestrators, FastAPI applications, or `aiohttp` routines using `async`/`await`.
*   **Go SDK:** Relies on Go's native concurrency model. All network I/O is inherently non-blocking under the hood. While the API surface appears synchronous, it is designed to be highly concurrent and performant when spawned within standard goroutines.

### 2. Timeouts and Task Cancellation
*   **Python SDK:** Timeouts and cancellations are generally handled through `asyncio` timeouts, task cancellation, or specific configuration parameters passed during connection setup.
*   **Go SDK:** Has native, deep integration with `context.Context`. Every network request, wait-for-ready loop, and command execution accepts a context parameter, granting fine-grained control over cancellation and timeouts across the entire lifecycle.

### 3. Resource Cleanup
*   **Python SDK:** 
    *   **Async Client:** Designed to be used as an async context manager (`async with AsyncSandboxClient(...) as client:`), guaranteeing immediate cleanup when the execution scope exits, even on exceptions.
    *   **Sync Client:** Automatic cleanup on program termination (via `atexit`) is **disabled by default**. It must be explicitly enabled by initializing the client with the `cleanup=True` parameter.
*   **Go SDK:** Idiomatically uses `defer` to ensure cleanup (e.g., `defer client.Close(ctx)`). 

### 4. Observability and Extensibility
*   **Python SDK:** Provides optional built-in tracing support. By installing the client with the tracing extra (`pip install "k8s-agent-sandbox[tracing]"`), developers can automatically hook into Google Cloud Trace and OpenTelemetry. 
*   **Go SDK:** While highly performant, it leaves tracing instrumentation up to the developer using standard Go profiling tools and spans wrapped around the client's execution paths.

### 5. Type Safety and Validation
*   **Python SDK:** Because Python is dynamically typed, the SDK relies heavily on `Pydantic` for configuring connection modes (e.g., `SandboxGatewayConnectionConfig`). This provides strong runtime type-checking and validation of user inputs.
*   **Go SDK:** Relies on Go's strict static typing and native structs. Most validation (like ensuring a port is an integer) is caught at compile-time by the Go compiler. Additional runtime constraints are handled via explicit validation methods rather than a heavy reflection-based library.

### 6. GKE Pod Snapshot Extension (State Preservation)
*   **Python SDK:** Ships with a dedicated `PodSnapshotSandboxClient` extension tailored for GKE clusters running gVisor. This allows for advanced agentic workflows where a sandbox can be "parked" between user prompts to save costs. 
    *   **Snapshots:** Trigger manual snapshots (`sandbox.snapshots.create()`) to preserve the filesystem and memory state.
    *   **Suspend:** Seamlessly scale a sandbox down to 0 replicas (`sandbox.suspend(snapshot_before_suspend=True)`), actively halting compute cost while keeping the state intact.
    *   **Resume:** Instantly scale back to 1 replica (`sandbox.resume()`), automatically restoring the environment from the latest snapshot.
*   **Go SDK:** Currently lacks a high-level abstraction for GKE Pod Snapshots. Developers working in Go who need state preservation must manually interact with the standard Kubernetes Go client to create `PodSnapshotManualTrigger` custom resources alongside their `agent-sandbox` client logic.
