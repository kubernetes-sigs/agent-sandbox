## Summary

<!--
A brief, one-paragraph summary of the enhancement.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of this KEP.
Describe the problem that this KEP is trying to solve and why it is important.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is the core of the specification. It should contain enough detail for a reviewer
(human or AI) to understand the proposal and its implementation.
-->

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do when this KEP is implemented.
Consider the different personas who might use this and what they want to accomplish.
-->

### High-Level Design

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your change are understandable at a high level.
It should focus on the "what" and "how" at a system level, not the implementation details of individual functions.
-->

#### API Changes

<!--
Describe any changes to the APIs of agent-sandbox.
-->

#### Implementation Guidance

<!--
This section provides guidance for the implementation of the KEP.
It is intended to be read by a human developer or an LLM.

It can include:
- Pointers to existing code that can be reused or should be modified.
- Suggestions for libraries or frameworks to use.
- High-level descriptions of algorithms or logic, without writing the full code.
- Any other context that would be helpful for implementation.
-->

## Scalability

<!--
Consider the impact of the change on the performance and resource consumption of the system, especially at scale.

For example:
- Will this feature increase the time taken by any operations?
- Will this feature lead to a non-negligible increase in resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, I/O)?
- Can this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?
- What are the expected performance characteristics of the feature?
- How will the feature behave in large-scale environments (e.g., many nodes, high request rates, large number of objects)?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? 
These do not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough information
to express the idea and why it was not chosen.
Any significant drawbacks of the proposed solution can be mentioned here in the context of the alternatives.
